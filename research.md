## Bio

I am an economist and the Richard S. Leghorn (1939) Career Development Professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a Faculty Research Fellow at the NBER.  My research is primarily focused on issues in information systems, market design, labor economics and organizational economics, particularly in the context of online markets. I am also interested in the effects of AI on labor markets and the potential of AI to improve social science methodology.
