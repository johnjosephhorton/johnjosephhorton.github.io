# Speculative Thoughts on Social & Economic Implications of new AI developments

**Overview**
Playing with ChatGPT gave me a “how is this real life?” feeling. I haven’t had that about any technology in a long time. The point of this memo is to put some ideas down while this is still quite new and see how they pan out in a few years. Some predictions are very speculative, of course. I’ll probably keep adding to this as I have more thoughts. 

**What is this, economically?**
Maybe the best way to describe it is that the marginal cost of a certain kind of human information processing/information-generating activity is now close to zero. 

**Work**
This kind of AI will likely be a strong complement to most knowledge workers rather than a substitute. Based on my explorations, it seems more like giving a carpenter power tools than building a robot carpenter. If workers are that much more productive, will firms want to hire more or fewer of them? Society?

Writing as a signal of ability is mostly gone. Well-constructed, well-organized writing now means almost nothing about the “author.” It will really be about detecting novel ideas or really thoughtful, original analyses, which will be hard for most people to do. Writing length as a signal of effort is dead. 

However, we might get better writing as the AIs can help us find weaknesses in our arguments.

**Human / Machine Arbitrage**
Remote work will create opportunities for arbitrage where orchestrated and lightly supervised bots will pass off machine-generated work as human work. Firms will care, at least for some time.

Imagine the world where all clothing was made by hand. Clothes were expensive (price = marginal cost). All of a sudden, there are people on the market who secretly have power looms, unlimited cotton, unlimited automated stitching machines, etc. They are going to try to flood the market, getting the “human-made” price at the machine-made price. This will take some time to re-equilibrate.

There will be an increase in demand for people who know how to work well with an AI. Knowledge about what kinds of tasks it is good for; how to create good prompts; how to glue together various systems, and so on. AI wrangler of sorts will become a real job.

There’s going to be a great interest in finding ways of knowing what is created by a real human and what is not. Bots will try to find ways to imitate “hand made.”

**AI Ecosystems**
We will see lots of meta-AIs that get good at routing questions to the appropriate AIs for a particular kind of question or task. There will be complex chains of payments made for AI calls to the right AIs. There will be markets where AIs bid for the right to answer questions they think they can answer well. There will be markets for human experts to re-train on answers that were not good. There probably will be some sort of conversational AI version of Wikipedia—maybe sponsored by Wikipedia.

There will likely be lots of combinatorial innovation as people learn to route outputs from one AI to another, creating novel kinds services / outputs.

**Education**
Any kind of assessment is going to be done in person, with exam proctors. Paper exams, no computers. Preference for multiple choice and so on.

AI tutors will become a big thing. There will be human tutor wranglers who pay attention to what the AI is
